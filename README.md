<i>like Gartic Phone, but with more art theft</i><br><br>

Made over a weekend because somebody told me I never actually make the projects I talk about. TAKE THAT, ADAM!<br>
Runs using a local install of StableDiffusion via the A1111 WebUI's API.<br>
Disclaimer: Very hacky as of now. It works, but it'll probably crash if you look at it the wrong way

*Disclaimer 2: General style (and probably some css) taken from cobalt.tools!*

*Disclaimer 3: I don't support art theft, and AI "art" is often used to replace artists, which sucks. This isn't doing that though*
